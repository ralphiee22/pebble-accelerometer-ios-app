pebble-accelerometer-ios-app
============================

This project uses the pebble smartwatch to send the accelerometer data to the iPhone. 
The iPhone writes the data to a text file where it time stamps the beginning of data 
collection and the end. Currently, the project only works with 10hz and 25z. I will 
be working on it to get it working for 50hz.
